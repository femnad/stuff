A container repo for throwaway stuff.

## Role call ##

### abry ###

Lazily add [fish shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) abbreviations. Hardcodes the abbreviations file like a boss.

### einy ###

Add a host name to a group in [Ansible inventory file](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_inventory.html#hosts-and-groups). Don't know if it'll work with default group, or at all.

### fred ###

A [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi/) helper for [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) interaction.

### hazy ###

Add a hostname for a host to the user's SSH configuration file. Tries really hard not to mess up with the existing file. But is it enough?

### wstr ###

Append a profile to AWS credentials file, but like a cave person, i.e. do not check if the profile already exists. Was useful for testing [Minio](https://github.com/minio/minio) once.
