A container repo for throwaway stuff.

## Role call ##

### abry ###

Lazily add [fish shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) abbreviations. Hardcodes the abbreviations file like a boss.

### hazy ###

Add a hostname for a host to the user's SSH configuration file. Tries really hard not to mess up with the existing file. But is it enough?
